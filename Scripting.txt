SCRIPTING




WAS Administration using the scripting




																Work on different resources
																ooooo													at  the end of the day youve a master repositor
	                   Connector---->	mbean service			ooooo mbeans 
		wsadmin								
			|\													Transient mbean --------->on the fly
			| \													Non Transient mbean -------> config
			|  \												
		jacl	jython												
																
		Bean Scripting framework								1. control 		operations
																2. configure 	operations
																3. deployment 	operations
																
	it is going to convert, take this bean and convert and apply to the mbean server															
																
																
													Websphere Objects			Implemented as part of jython and jacl --- In both the objects are there.
													-----------------
													1. Admin config 	---> confog
													2. Admin control
													3. Admin app	 	---> deploy
													4. Admin task	 	---> easy way to perform the Admin(Config + Control)
													5. Help
													
													
													Ex:
													Admin config.create datasource 
													AdminConfig.createServer
													AdminApp.Install -----
													
												There are methods on the objects you'll call to perform the operations.
												
									Adminconfig.save() ---> saving into master repository (before that itll be in the tmp)
									
									AdminConfig.sync() --->	syncs the data
									
									To connect:
									./wsadmin -lang <Jython/Jacl > -userName xxxx -password xxxx [By default it is jacl, there is a config called wsadmin.conf]	
									
									dmgr ---> properties ---> wsadmin.properties file 
									
								  -> its gonna save the host information(scripting.host/default_language jacl/epoch parameters/trace file path/tracestring/)
													
													by using this it is going to connect to the mbean
													
													BY def wsadmin connects to mbean through SOAP protocol
													
													By using none mode i can directly conncet to the master repository but i can only perform AdminConfig operations
													
													
													When the jvm is down, if you want to update some configuration then you'll use that
													
													Ex: Security.xml ---> Enable true /false
														In that cases you can connect directly to the repository.
														
														Conn type ---> None 
														
														-parameter -lang jython
														
														AdminControl.getNode() ---> you'll get the node you're currently in
														
														They wrote the jython commands to talk to the mbeans 
														
														
								SoapClient.properties
								
								
								
								what is Scripting Library?
								
								AppServer Scripting Libraries..
								
								
								usingh jenkins we performed scripts of deployment mserver with passwordless ssh
