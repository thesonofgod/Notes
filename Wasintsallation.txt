JMX java management Xtension ----> M bean interface

For every compnent you have a 'mbean' to control and monitor my component 

				Extensions controls the

						Component 
-------->						
1.	$$$	Console (IS-ELITE) 
							Talking with mbeans to control the components
						
						
2.	$$$	Yu can also control the mbean using the commandline
		
		You need to have some kind of scripting in the command line to talk to the bean
		./wsadmin script which actuallly will take 
				-- jython
				-- jackal(gone)
				
				
3.	$$$	I can also directly talk to the mbean api using the java code to control and monitor the components.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!What is the difference between coding and scripting!!

- Scripting will convert into beans and talk to the jmx

- API you re writing the java code requiered to talk with the api 

Bean - Which has a property with setters and getters 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

xml files - how to start websphere info

--->the master repository willl have info about all the nodes

Then it'll fedarate to other nodes its going to synchronize from master repository to your nodes.

EJB container And Web Container --- Websphere

ADmin service --- collection of admin m beans which are there in your application server


Admin "service" -> it should be consumable (Provides an interface to talk to the mbeans) -> talk to mbeans via admin service
 
Client EJB i can talk to EJB

webservice using HTTP call i can talk to the web

service --> consumable / interact 

IIOP used to communication between client and server in EJB


./wsadmin talks with 'admin service' using IIOP or webservice


./wsadmin ---->   	IIOP						  		 ------>	admin service
			-->		Webservices(SOAP) -----> Webservices ------>    admin service

API  													------->    admin service 

(9060 http port) SOAP protocol --- > it is built on top of the http protocol

mbeans will write the data into the repository

each and every jvm has admin service

admin service is running on the jvm

mbean is in the application server jvm

Repository ---> Set of configuration files for your entire cell.

				If you go into your machine 
				
											DMGR Profile ---> Profile name --> config ----> cells ----> cell01---> xml files resources.xml security.xml cell.xml 																																that is the master repository
											
											It collects all the configuration details to run your cell01 !! dmgr nodes jvm etc blah blah
											
											cell.xml 		---> contains data about the cell 
										
											resoucrces.xml 	---> they configured at the cell level
											
											security.xml    ---> it will have details about the secuirty details( USER ID PASSWROD(ENCRYTPED))
											
											you shoud not never touch the xml file directly
											
											you need to talk through the admin services
									
							We can edit the hosts
							
							serviceindex.xml contains all the information about the hosts
							
							all the info is in the xml files
							
							under the node you will se the node agent which is also a server
							
							under the node agent you'll see the server.xml node.xml
							
							
							
							Where is the application being deployed
							
							
							
							
							When you deploy the application you're giving the jndi names etc you're altering the orginial deplyment unit
							
							
				ivt.ear		The orginal deployment file is going to convert into 
									
										1. binary
									+ 
										2. config

			Websphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr1/config/cells/Cells01/applications/ivt application.ear/deployments					
											
											
											
Installed Apps is a binary is not going to read any configuration details its only going to read class files.
											
											
									All the configuration details are read from deployments.
											
								Modifications are stored in the config file in the deployments folder.
								
								
								Binary 	(installed Apps)				+ 			Config(Deployments)
								basic ear file											Changes made 
								
		Under the cell name there are clusters which has information about the clusters
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		Temp:
		
		/tmp    			Temp is 
		
		When you go to the console you modified the parameter 
		
		Before you save it its going to save it in the tmp 
		
		Once you save it it takes to the location it needs to go
		
		First tmp ----> main repository
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		
	^^	There is a backup directory 
		
		During the changes it'll take automatic backups						
																
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------										
Application.xml

contains info about the application context path and all the info about the information

I gave you a brand new system

Dmgr machine Ip address 

How can you go to the console


ps -ef| grep java 

you can find the dmgr out of it go to the path serverindex.xml and login to the console

or else find serverindex.xml and login to the console

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Without nodeagent you cannot start the jvm's 	
2. Eventhough the dmgr is down the application will run. Only thing is you cannot deploy or manage and can still serve the client requests.
3.				 To add a current node to another dmgr you will have to remove the node from the first dmgr.

Dmgr with high availability is important

IF DMGR IS DOWN YOU CAN START THE NODEAGENT.

You can create a cluster only in a cell not across the cell
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed process recovery

_______---> node agent will communicate with the dmgr by using the cell discovery address

_______---> dmgr will talk to the node agent using the node discovery address

Managed process 

_______---> jvms under the node will talk to the node by using the node multi cast discovery address(pg:20)
				If i need to talk to one system to another i need to talk to the port if a jvm needs to talk to 10 jvms to the node agent needs 10 ports
								So multi cast is used by the nodeagent to talk to the 10 jvms

All this information can be found under the serverindex.xml file

Node is a logical term | node agent is a process 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There is an administrative agent and a job manager

By default it is going to synchronize every sixty seconds.

If you dont want to synchronize some of the files you can put that into a list(exclusions)
 nodes --> node --> nodeagent --> file sync
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Epoch and digest

iF you modify the xml on the fly then the jvm doesnt know! because it is keeping old digest and epoch value because you did not modify via console or wsadmin

so its gonna keep the old value

Page 22 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

																			-------------------
1. custom																	|	Server		  |
2. standalone															/	|		Profile	  | == == myapplications + islite
3. cell													ADMIN Agent||DMGR	|				  |
4. dmgr																	\	|	Server		  |
5. job manager											But more payment	|		Profile-2 | == == myapps + islite
6. administratvie agent                                                     |                 |
												 10k	Not cost effective  |    \   ""       |
																			|				  |
																			|	\  	""		  |
																			-------------------
														so Administrative agent comes to play to manger both the servers

Admin agent can start stop and run python script but cannot do in console

														
			   //====== Cell1
			  //
			 //======= Cell2	
			//											Job manager can connect to the admin agent	
Job manager ||======== Cell3							Job manager can do limited operations like starting stoping etc.,
			 \\
			  \\====== ADmin agent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

websphere supports java 1.6 and java 1.7

Manage JDK managesdk.sh can change from 1.6 to 1.7 java

synchronization is a one way process
if i want to update a file in dmgr ---> refresh epoch
sync node --- dmgr hostname and soap port

Load Balancer  ----------			IHS		      				 	WAS					                                        4 core machine
				\		              Plugin																				Weight based Load Balancing you can 
				 \					               xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx											set weights for machine like 2 for 2 core 4 for 4 core
				  \---------------  IHS           					WAS									
				   				      Plugin																				its going to maintain the stickiness once 
									  																			it'll get request.
									  
						******			what are the different sections we have in the plugin.xml		  
									  1. maintain the IHS from was console
									  2. plugin xml  ----> need to look into the plugin.xml file
									  
									  		i. Virtual Hosts
											ii. Clusters
													- Information about what type of algorithm you're using
															- Weight based load balancing 
																(Round Robin)
															- Random Load Balancing	
											iii. URI (Paths that it will allow)
													- specify the context roots that you're going to accept
											iv.  Route --> will have the combination of URI, CLuster and virtual Host.
													
													
						When the plugin is executing it is going to start from the bottom, it'll check if it can server the request in that route
						If cannot satisfy from all the routes
						it'll serve from websphereee!! server if it cannot then it'll start from IHS server 
						
						Observer the plugin file
						
						How can make it work by using the WAS console how can I control my IHS's.
						
						Console
						Creating the webserver from an unmanaged node
						
						webserver we gave
											 adminctl start for the unmanaged node 
											 user id and password for that webserver
											 we altered te port number and server name in the admin.conf file to suit our webserver
											 
									/opt/IBM HTTP Server/bin>./htpasswd.sh /opt/IBM HTTP Server/conf/admin.passwd webadmin
									give the password for the webadmin user
									
						managed node its easy to create the webservers and generate the config files
						
						ADD points on cloud and mq  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

								If you want to control the order of execution
								
								I NEED TO START Z BEFORE X OR Y THEN YOU need to give weight. The one which has more weight will start first.
								
										Name service uses the Bootstrap port -------------------> Intial context lookup in EJB

 																														!!SECURITY!!
 
 
 Security is a component within websphere
 
 	   	Security component will run in Dmgr, node, nodeagent, etc.
  
  		To communicatie between dmgr and node it'll talk to the security component.
		
		secuirty.xml ---> cell level 
							
		----> You want to keep track of who logged in and what is changed.
		----> enable the security you'll enable by using the service account.
					
					----> Request the LDAP a service account
					   
					   LDAP 								---> Heirarchial Database
					   hostname and port number 								|
					   														IT	|------------------------by i
																				|                 |--   |
																				|						|------	
																			CS	|-----						|  |
																				|    |						|  |
																			EE	|
							
  
  cn = prashanth O= us, ou = IT

  RootDn
  
  Service account ---> given only to one person, can add authorative to one person, nobody uses that
  hostname
  portname
  
  base distinguished name ----> where do i need to start the search, su = engineering, ou = it, 
  bind distinguished name ----> same as service account
  
  by using bind account you'll look into your account 
  
  Authentication
  ----> Who you're
  Authorization															Even though im authenticated im not able to authorized the account
  ----> giving permission on the resources
  
  Roles																			Groups
 -------																	   --------	
 				Acts on Resource											Collection of users
 A role basically tells what are things that i can access.					
 It act on top of the resource.
 
 ---> In the Admin console i need to give some kind of authorization on a group or user.
 			
			** There are predefined roles in websphere
					- Administrator
					- Secuirty Administrator
					- Monitor				  ---> only for non prod we will give	 
					- Deployer
					- Configurator
			
			Once i enable the global secuirty fo rmy users i need to add a particular role.
			
					
					
 Creating your own security 
 
 	- If you have two clusters 1. ABC  ---> Admin Privileges
								2. XYZ ---> general Privilegas
								
								
								You can create custom roles and give permissions like this to the cluster level.
								
								
								We need to stop the entire node or you need to turn of the security and completely disable and enable it and restart everything
								
								
								In the secuirty.xml in that particular node enabled = true
								
								If we use the syncNode.sh to sync the node with the current security
								
			Test ---------------------------------------------------------+++
			
			Creating the security issue: 
					
					1. Stop a node 2.
					2. Disable the security
					3. Restart the Dmgr
					4. stop the node 1. if you can't because of security then kill the process using the kill from command line.
					5. Enable the dmgr global secuirty
					6. Restart the dmgr 
					7. solve the problem
								
								Either enable security ie make it true in the security.xml 
								or
								use syncNode.sh to sync the node with the security details along with the other details.

All the information is in the EAR file
								
 
 		---->	If you're creating a datasource all the connection information is within the EAR file itself.
		---->   That is the advantage of enhanced EAR
		----> 	JDBC,JMS, Class Loader --> can be configured at the application level
		---->	Will not be useful by JAS authentication alias(DB), virtual hosts, shared libraries ---> Server level
		---->   if you take that enhanced ear and deploy it in other conatiners it will not work, it will only work in the websphere 
		
		
		
		Scopes: 
		
		When you create at cell level all the jvms under the cell will inherit that is it can use the data source or the other details
		
		If i create that at the cluster level all the servers under that will inherit
		
		If under that node, it'll take from the node level

 If your application is running and want to update the application.
 
 (if you need to update a jsp or image.)
 
 When you update the application ---> its going to stop your applciation ---------> start the application.
 
 
 There is a roll out update ----> its basically 1. It's going to work one node at a time.
 												
												
						__-----> If you want to replace a particular module you can click on particular module and update it.
 
 
 
 
 System Recovery

Usually the dmgr is stopped but if you use the no stop mode then it'll work

			


TroubleShooting
---------------

Why do you get error 404 and 500

https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27035752


What are the symptopms::;


--> file is not openinig etc etc

Where is the problem occuring?????????????????

IHS layer plugin or websphere server.


IHS algorithms -----------------------------------------> RoundRobin and Random

St3 problem the load balancer problem..?

One of the developer, came and told that IHS is not doing the round robin, vertical cluster 4 jvm's in the same machine. requests are only going to the one jvm rest are idle..

not able to access the files faster..

when you send  arequest ot the first jvm.. 

its going to maintian the counter for the plugin..

by using the jsession id its routing the session data is retained..

somebody went to the first jvm, 50 req gave so counter is 50..

somebody suddenly started the load test..

my counter of jvm 1 is 50 the rest are 0's

all the 50 req went to the second jvm

since it is a tcp session it has to maintian the sticky session

the 50 req are going to the same jvm due to the session affinity

until you stop the load test it  gonna go to the same jvm all the 50 req

Yes there is an issue now..

load balncer is our problem

the application dosent require to maintain session affinity

req --> response

(to get the batch procession to get pound data....)

Im gonna send the data and ask how much im gonna use..

to solve this problem..

remove the session affinity..
 			removed the clone id from the xml file
			
			enabled the logs in plugin... so knew that all the files were going to the same jvm
			Each req is going to take it as independent now and now its gonna send across the four jvm's
			
			
			Then resolved the problem. 
			
			we are tuning the application... we are adjusting the parameters..
			
			
			--->	Same time everyday / peak load condition
			
			--->	1-5 pm is a peak load
			
			is this occurring ?
			
			have the problem occur after a configuration change?
			
			slowly the problem is progressing there is a problem with that
			
			can the problem be reproduced?
			
			are you able to collect the data and give it to us.

	logs:
	
				System err 
				System out
				Native std err 
				Native std out
				
				logs called first failure detection service..
				FFDC
				
				where is FFDC 
				
				logs folder ---> FFDC 
				it contains logs files.. 
				any failure in the internal components of websphere it is going to write into the ffdc logs
				
				its also going to put a statement in the System.out logs
				
				
		Diagnostic Trace:
		
				You're going to collect the data of a particular component in the trace field
				
				useful to get the trace lot more logs from the internal components of the websphere
				
				Ejb has some problem then they will ask you a trace and we can send the data to them
				
				
				
				Basic mode---> default format
				
				HPEL (High Performance Extensible logging) is gonna be in binary format( only for systemout and systemerr and tracelog)
				
				in order to view it there is log viewer tool by using that you can view the logs
				
				Less IO compared to the Basic mode.....
				
				Cross component tracing.....
				
						For example if i hava web module..
						i deployed in one cluster
						ihave a ejb module deployed it in another cluster
						
						
						when i send a req from ejb to web module
						
						i want to track the transaction
						
						
						i want to trace how web module is talking to ejb module
						
						by using the cross component trace you can do that
						
						
				console ---> troblushooting --> Enable the log and trace correlation
				
				it gonna save in the trace.log
				
				
			log loglevel=	"error"---> change it to debug Name = "path for http_plugin.log" ---> debug for the http_plugin.log
			
			it will generate trace which will ease to debug..
			
			**Hand Detection policy:
			
			I made a request to execute the query to database..
			
			the query took 5 min
			its going to write in the log that hey one thread is hang and it is took more than 10 min...
			Systemout.log its gonna write this
			
			you can take  athread dump and see what that thread is doing..
			
			
			once the thread is completed, its going to write in systemout.log it will write that its completed
			
			hang detection policy... by default its going to write
			
			
			can change the threshold
