										
																		JENKINs

 We need to do five things at the end of this exercise

** 1. we should be able to execute the remote ssh 

** 2. we should be able to pass a parameter from one job to other job

** 3. How to install jenkins and run it up

** 4. What is a slave node and how to use a slave node. (remote box lo slave node)

** 5. How can I connect to the git and run a maven build

** 6. perform the deployment using the python script



Step 1 : Install Java ---> sudo yum install java | sudo yum install wget Check the java versions and compatibility
	
Step 2 : wget Tomcat ---> start the tomcat

enterprise-linux-7

Learn how to give permissions to the whole folders 


Step 3 : wget Jenkins ---> 

								* copy the jenkins in the webapps of the tomcat folder. 
								* go to the browser servername:8080 and then /jenkins to access the jenkins the front page
								
wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war

Step 4 : Install the war file on the jenkins

Step 5 : Connect to the ip:8080/jenkins to use the UI of the jenkins

Step 6 : Install and configure plugins



Password less Ssh:

Step 1 : download the plugin file for ssh
Step 2 : manage system config
Step 3 : set the key to private key of the jenkins machine
Step 4 : give the user name of the required machine you want to connect and also the ip address of the machine
Step 5 : save and apply

How to do sftp:

machine 1 			Machine 2 
X						Y

Step 1 : ssh-keygen in the x
Step 2 : copy the id_rsa pub of x to the authorized keys of y in the .ssh folder
Step 3 : set the permission of ssh to 700 and authorized key to 600
Step 4 : sftp username@ipaddress to sftp to the machine y from x

Adding a slave to the master:
http://scmquest.com/jenkins-master-slave-setup-and-configuration-with-screenshots/

Step 1 : Systems config lo you need to change the private key to that of the slave to talk to wasadmin
Step 2 : SFTP to the master repo and WASADMIN with the newly created slave
Step 3 : We need to create a node (manage nodes) and give the private ip of jenkins and user of the

Few Basics Concepts:

* the term build may refer to the process by which source code is converted into a stand alone form that can be rum on a computer or to the for, itself.

* one of the most important steps of a software build is the complitation process, where source code files are converted into executable code.

* builds are created when a certain point in development has been reached or the code has been deemed ready for implementation, either for testing or outright release 

* a build is also known as code build or software build


BUILD mean compilation of the code. . 

After compilation you're going to creata  jar file dll war file er fille etc 

c++ class files


Build Artifacts:

* IN sdlc artifact usually refers to things that are produced by people involved in the process.

* the artifacts created during the build hob are called build artifacts 

* The build artifacts include reports, websites or files

* thers artifacts can be shared between multiple builds also

The end part of the build is called artifacts.

	JENKINS
	-------
	
	Continous build tool written in java
	
	java -jar jenkins.war to run jenkins as a server of its own
	it does not need tomcat or any other but it can also run on it and other servlet containers
	
Terms:

Server:
	Whenever you install you get a gui and using which you're going install the plugins, builds, configure the entire system. 
	
Master: 
	The word is relative. it has some slaves. This refers to the jenkins server host only. 
	
	Master is like dmgr and the slaves are like nodes
	
	
	Slave - client - agent
	
Executor: 
	As many number of exxecutors you've for your master. Those many processes can run.
	If agent has 4 executors then 4 jobs can be run at the same time.
	
	
	
	


ITEM :


You need to create a item and it has different options and then create a job using the monitor and external job

Like nightly backup etc etc



How to deploy
Where to deploy
Where is my package

1. Dev
2. ST/QA
3. Performance Testing
4. Prod

I cant create a job for each environment
I need to give knowledge where is the prod where is the dev
I need to give knowledge to the jenkins
I need to choose where i want to deploy
