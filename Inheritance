Inheritance:


Multiple Inheritance is not supported in JAVA
			Ambiguity Problem


If there is a class A 
and it has a method show()

There is main class B and a B obj = new B(); object is present, then the obj.show() call the method from class A.

This is known as Inheritance.

If there are two classes Class A and Class B
				Both have		show()

		There is one more Class C

		C is inheriting from both Class A and Class B

		obj.show();
		Now this shows a error because it will understand where to call the show() from? From Class A or Class B?
