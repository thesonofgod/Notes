SSL

ikeyman




i want to send the data in a secure way

i want to encrypt it even if any one wants to reads it from the tcp ip packets




browser ---> encrypt --> decrypt ---> Server



When i encrypt the payload size will go up because we are encrypting the data when you decrypt it the cpu cycles will be more..

so only if you need to encrypt hen encrypt


There are two type of encryption algorithms we have.
---------------------------------------------------

**Symmetric													**ASymmetric

old days														Public key to encrpt the message
kings 															Private key to decrypt the message
one guy sends info                								
and decoding is done

Same key to encrypt and decrypt
																
																Key databse files(Kdb) for IHS----> to store the certificates
																
																We put certificates in the key database file 
																
																
																LDAP: 
																Tivoli directory service --heirarchial data base
																Sun LDAP
																ACtive Directory
																
																
																Application server

.kdb to store certificates																		
.p12 is for websphere key database file

The websphere the way it performs is one is it has the 	
															trust store.. 										Key store
															
											P12 files		Public Key											Private key						P12 Files
														
																If i dont have the public key it cannot do anything.
																
																
																This is called one way SSl
																
There is a two way SSL
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   |	TrustStore 			----->						KeyStore  |
   |			Sends public key, will decrypt it at here												  |
   |															  |
   | 															  |
   |															  |
   | 	 KeyStore										TrustStore|
   |----------------------------------------------------------------
																

Self signed certificate   	
Once you recieve the certificate you'll sign the certificate

in the local you'll sign the certificate


Third part certificate
verisign and other companies that are third party which sign the certificates
signer certificate

If you want to generate the certificates you'll use the Ikeyman tool... there is one more tool ...it is kdb ssh or something which is used for generating the certificates.


X11 forwarding
 
 personal certificate request
 
 the third party will sign it
